Python Script to generate IPR UTD Data XML files from CSV input files. 

** README to Follow ***

** CODE NOT READY FOR GENERAL USAGE **

** Specifying your input file **

In the SETUP.cfg file you can insert the file name (or path to the file if it is placed in a different directory/folder)
of the file containing the raw data for processing. 

The Python script will check (1) if this is done correctly in the config file and then subsequently checks (2) if the
file specified actually exists. If either of these cases are false then the script will exit with an error message.
